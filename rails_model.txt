Decided not to map the root of my application to one of my scaffold index pages because I made separate tabs on my index.html for each assignment. I added a new tab for the scaffold index pages instead with descriptions of each model's intended purpose.

In case you aren't able to access the index.html, the scaffold index pages are:
